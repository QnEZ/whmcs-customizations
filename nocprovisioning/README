This is a customized version of
the nocprovisioning module from
maxnet. It enables the creation
of VMs on Citrix XenServers in
combination with NOC-PS provisioning
system.

The following has to be done to
use it:

a) configure NOC-Details in include/citrix.php 
   (NOC-PS-Server-IP,adminuser,adminpassword)

b) configure NOC-PS API password in 
   nocprovisioning.php
   (Hmm, dont no where to set this in nocps)
   (#TODO!)

c) Configure your WHMCS-Server
   
   on your whmcs server create a directory
   /var/www/.ssh
   (Directory Hardcoded)
   
   create 2 ssh-keys in this directory called
   1) id_citrix_vminfo
   2) id_citrix_info

   Create a file ~/www-data/.ssh/config for
   every XenServer, for ssh to connect without
   further options(Maybe not necessary). example:

    Host myxenserver.mydomain.com 1.2.3.4
        Port 59172

d) Configure your XenServer in NOC-PS 

e) Copy XenServer according to README file in
   folder citrix_xenserver_files
